# Classroom-VR
An interactive classroom VR experience

The aims of this project is to bring a classroom learning enviornment to VR. Right now we are working with the HTC Vive, but
plan to expand to other forms of VR like the Oculus and Google Cardboard.

To get started clone the repository and open it up in Unity.

You must have a Vive pre configured with Steam VR for the VR aspect to work.
